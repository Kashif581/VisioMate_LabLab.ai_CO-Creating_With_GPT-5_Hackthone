* Are you visually impaired?
* Do you feel left out?
* Do you find it difficult to navigate?
* Do you always have to wait for someone to help you?
* Do you feel sad when you bump into something and people laugh at you?

### VisioMate
---
When youâ€™re crossing the road and see a car coming toward you, you can instantly estimate how far away it is. This quick, almost instinctual judgment comes from your spatial understanding of the surroundings. Based on this sense, you can decide whether to speed up, stop, or keep walking.
VisioMate, powered by computer vision, works in a similar way to help visually impaired people navigate obstacles. It captures objects in real time and guides users by telling them what is in front of them.
